# GopherFS

An  application  that  tries  to  interpret  the  Gopher protocol into a
filesystem.

Due to limitations in the gopher standard does gopherfs need to download
the the whole files before they can be accessed. A cache of these  files
is created in ~/.gopherfs or /tmp, if $HOME is not set.

Usage:
	gopherfs gopher://server:port/type/query $mountpoint

Have fun.
